# CDE Demo

This project is an entry level tutorial for CDE.

The CDE CLI commands are based on [this tutorial](https://www.cloudera.com/tutorials/cdp-using-cli-api-to-automate-access-to-cloudera-data-engineering.html) by the Cloudera Marketing Team, which additionally contains an example of the CDE REST API.



## Project Overview

The project includes three sections:

1. Creating and scheduling a simple Spark Job via the Cloudera Data Engineering Experience ([CDE](https://docs.cloudera.com/data-engineering/cloud/index.html))
2. Creating and scheduling an Airflow Job via CDE
3. Creating and scheduling Spark Jobs via the CDE CLI via Cloudera Machine Learning ([CML](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/index.html))


#### Peoject Setup

Clone this github repository locally in order to have the files needed to run through Sections 1 and 2. The files are located in the "manual_jobs" folder.


#### Section 1 - Creating and scheduling a simple Spark Job

Log into the CDE experience and create a new resource from the "Resources" tab. Please pick a unique name. 

A resource allows you to upload files and dependencies for reuse. This makes managing spark-submits easier.

Upload the files located in the "manual_jobs" directory of this project in your CDE resource. 

Next, we will create three jobs with the following settings. 

* Open each file and manually change table names to something that you can remember and is unique enough. 
* For each of these, go to the "Jobs" tab and select "Create Job". Choose type "Spark" and pick the corresponding files from your resource.

It is important that you stick to the following naming convention. Do not schedule the jobs as we will launch them with Airflow in the next section. 

1. LC_data_exploration:
    - Name: "LC_data_exploration"
    - Application File: "LC_data_exploration.py"
    - Python Version: "Python 3"
    
2. LC_KPI_reporting:
    - Name: "LC_KPI_reporting:
    - Application File: "LC_KPI_reporting.py"
    - Python Version: "Python 3"
    
3. LC_ml_scoring:
    - Name: "LC_ml_scoring"
    - Application File: "LC_ml_model.py"
    - Python Version: "Python 3"
    
You can now manually launch each of the above. Just make sure you run them in order. 


#### Section 2 - Creating and scheduling an Airflow Job via CDE

CDE uses Airflow for Job Orchestration. Follow these steps to create a CDE job of type "Airflow".

* First, edit the "LC_airflow_config.py" file by setting the DAG name (line 22) to the name you will use for the Airflow Job.

* Next, set each "job_name" (lines 37, 43, 49) to the same job names you used in Section 1. They have to match or it won't work.  

* Finally, ensure the "cli_conn_id" variable at line 61 is up to date. This is used to issue queries to Hive in CDW from the Airflow Job. To configure a new connection go to the CDE VPC and select "Cluster Details". Then open the Airflow UI and click on "Admin" -> "Connection". Click on "Add a new record" and use [these instructions](https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Community-Articles/Airflow-Job-scheduling-with-CDE-and-CDW-ETL-jobs/ta-p/311615) to configure a new connection. 

* In order to create an Airflow job, go to the "Jobs" page and create one with type "Airflow". Name the job as you'd like and choose the "LC_airflow_config.py" file. Execute or optionally schedule the job. Once it has been created, open the job from the "Jobs" tab and navigate to the "Airflow UI" tab. 

Next, click on the "Code" icon. This is the Airflow DAG we contained in the "LC_airflow_config.py" file. Notice there are two types of operators: CDWOperator and CDEJobRunOperator. You can use both to trigger execution from the CDE and CDW services (with Spark and Hive respectively). More operators will be added soon including the ability to customize these. 


#### Section 3 - Creating and scheduling Spark Jobs via the CDE CLI from CML

We will download the CDE CLI into a CML project and schedule CDE jobs from there. 

Please note that you can download the CDE CLI to your local machine and follow the same steps with [this tutorial](https://www.cloudera.com/tutorials/cdp-using-cli-api-to-automate-access-to-cloudera-data-engineering.html) by the Cloudera Marketing Team, which additionally contains an example of the CDE REST API.

###### Setup Steps

If you are working in CML, the "00_bootstrap.py" script takes care of most of the setup steps for you. However, you will still need to manually execute a couple of steps, please follow this order:

1. Go to the CML Project Settings and add the following environment variables to the project:
  * WORKLOAD_USER: this is your CDP user
  * CDE_VC_ENDPOINT: navigate to the CDE VPC Cluster Details page and copy the "JOBS API URL", then save it as a CML environment variable.

2. Launch a CML Session with Workbench Editor.
  * Run the "00_bootstrap.py" file but only up until line 49 (highlight the lines of code you want to run and then click on "Run" -> "Run Lines" from the top bar)
  * Manually download the CDE CLI for Linux to your local machine from the CDE VPC Cluster Details page.
  
![alt_text](https://github.com/pdefusco/myimages_repo/blob/main/download_cde_cli.png)
  
  * Upload the executable in the CML project home page
  * Uncomment and execute lines 53 to 57 in "00_bootstrap.py"
  
###### Exercise Steps

From the same CML Session, open the "01_cde_cli_intro.py" file and execute the commands one by one. The script includes notes and an explanation of each command.
